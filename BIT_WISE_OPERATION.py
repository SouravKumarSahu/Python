In decimal system base is 10, hence
number multiplied by 10 is bassically left shift of all digits by one place
12345 × 10 = 123450
number divided by 10 is bassically right shift of all digits by one place
123450 / 10 = 12345


Similarly in binary system base is 2, hence

bin 17 = {bin(17)}

digits multiplied by 2 is bassically left shift of all digits by one place
17 << 1 = {bin(17)} × {bin(2)} = {17 << 1} = bin {bin(17 << 1)}

digits divided by 2 is bassically right shift of all digits by one place
17 >> 1 = {bin(17)} / {bin(2)} = {17 >> 1} = bin {bin(17 >> 1)}

digits shifted by two place is like number multiplied/divided by 4 (i.e. 2 x 2)
17 << 2 = {17 << 2} = bin {bin(17 << 2)}

digits shifted by three place is like number multiplied/divided by 6 (i.e. 3 x 2)
17 >> 3 = {17 >> 3} = bin {bin(17 >> 3)}

digits shifted by four place is like number multiplied/divided by 8 (i.e. 4 x 2)
17 << 4 = {17 << 4} = bin {bin(17 << 4)}
